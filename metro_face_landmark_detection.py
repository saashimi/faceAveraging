#   This example program shows how to find frontal human faces in an image and
#   estimate their pose.  The pose takes the form of 68 landmarks.  These are
#   points on the face such as the corners of the mouth, along the eyebrows, on
#   the eyes, and so forth.
#
#   The face detector we use is made using the classic Histogram of Oriented
#   Gradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier, an image pyramid,
#   and sliding window detection scheme.  The pose estimator was created by
#   using dlib's implementation of the paper:
#      One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees by
#      Vahid Kazemi and Josephine Sullivan, CVPR 2014
#   and was trained on the iBUG 300-W face landmark dataset (see
#   https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/facial-point-annotations/):  
#      C. Sagonas, E. Antonakos, G, Tzimiropoulos, S. Zafeiriou, M. Pantic. 
#      300 faces In-the-wild challenge: Database and results. 
#      Image and Vision Computing (IMAVIS), Special Issue on Facial Landmark Localisation "In-The-Wild". 2016.
#   You can get the trained model file from:
#   http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2.
#   Note that the license for the iBUG 300-W dataset excludes commercial use.
#   So you should contact Imperial College London to find out if it's OK for
#   you to use this model file in a commercial product.
#
#
#   Also, note that you can train your own models using dlib's machine learning
#   tools. See train_shape_predictor.py to see an example.
#
#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#   or
#       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS
#   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some
#   things run faster.  
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake and boost-python installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by
#   running the command:
#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires scikit-image which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install scikit-image
#   Or downloaded from http://scikit-image.org/download.html.
